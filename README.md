# How to 3D print a digital dental model

This instruction is created for residents in the Division of Orthodontics at the Ohio State University. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the 3D printing engineer in the division.

# Outline

In this instruction, we will demonstrate how to

 - Export the digital file (STL file) from either 3Shape or iTero (Step 2),
 - Process the digital file to be printable using Meshmixer (Step 3),
 - 3D print those files (Steps 4-6)
 
# Equipment and Software
 - 3D printer: EnvisionOne (stereolithography)
 - Slicing software: Envision One RP
 - Printing material: E-model HS (resin)
 - Mesh processing software: Meshmixer

## Step 1. Intraoral scanning

There are two types of intraoral scanners available in our graduate ortho clinic:

 - 3Shape Trios
 - iTero element
 
 To learn how to conduct an intraoral scan, please ask our dental assistants.
When you plan to 3D print the model, please remember which scanner you used, because the way to export digital files (STL files) are different (see Step 2).

## Step 2. Export the intraoral scan

### 3Shape Trios
Find a computer with 3Shape OrthoAnalyzer. Details are coming soon.

### iTero element
Go to https://bff.cloud.myitero.com/login and log in.
Please contact the staffs if you need the login information.

## Step 3. Process the digital file
Basically, there are two types of intraoral scans:

|Type|Example|Printable|
|--|--|--|
|Scan with a base (closed surface)|![](type1.jpg)|Yes|
|Scan without a base (open surface)|![](type2.jpg)|No|
 
 
Please see the corresponding video to learn how to process the intraoral scan you plan to print.

## Step 4. Submit a job to 3D printer

Once the STL file you plan to print is ready, you can import the STL files into the slicing software (i.e., Envision One RP here). Please see the video below to learn the basic operation.

## Step 5. 3D printing

## Step 6. Post-process 3D printed models

You can export the current file by clicking **Export to disk** in the menu. You can choose to export the file as plain Markdown, as HTML using a Handlebars template or as a PDF.
