# How to 3D print a digital dental model

This instruction is created for residents in the Division of Orthodontics at the Ohio State University. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the 3D printing engineer in the division.

# Outline

In this instruction, we will demonstrate how to

 1. Export the digital file (STL file) from either 3Shape or iTero,
 2. Process the digital file to be printable using Meshmixer ,
 3. 3D print those files

## Step 1. Intraoral scanning

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

## Step 2. Export the intraoral scan

All your files and folders are presented as a tree in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the tree.

## Step 3. Process the digital file

You can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the **Rename** button in the file explorer.

## Step 4. Submit a job to 3D printer

You can delete the current file by clicking the **Remove** button in the file explorer. The file will be moved into the **Trash** folder and automatically deleted after 7 days of inactivity.

## Step 5. Post-process 3D printed models

You can export the current file by clicking **Export to disk** in the menu. You can choose to export the file as plain Markdown, as HTML using a Handlebars template or as a PDF.
