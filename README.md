# How to 3D print a digital dental model
# Updated by 07/12/2024
This instruction is created for residents in the Division of Orthodontics at The Ohio State University. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the 3D printing engineer in the division.

# Outline
In this instruction, we will demonstrate how to:

 - Export the digital file (STL file) from iTero (Step 1)
 - 3D print a STL file (Steps 2-4)
 - Additional information
 
# Equipment and Software
 - 3D printer: Einstein™ Dental 3D Printer or EnvisionOne  (stereolithography)
 - Slicing software: Live Build DLP (previously known as Envision One RP)
 - Printing material: Desktop Health Model Z (resin)

## Step 0. Intraoral scanning

The intraoral scanner we have in our graduate ortho clinc is iTero element 5D Plus. To learn how to conduct an intraoral scan, please ask our dental assistants.
The way to export digital files (STL files) are different (see Step 1).

## Step 1. Export an intraoral scan

Go to https://bff.cloud.myitero.com/login and log in, and then follow the video below.

Please contact the senior residents or staffs if you need the login information.


## Step 2. Submit a job to 3D printer

Once the STL file you plan to print is ready, you can import the STL files into the slicing software (i.e., Live Build DLP here). Please see the video below to learn the basic operation.
The video below will show you how to conduct a horizontal printing.
There are two different types of printing direction: horizontal and vertical. Please see the corresponding videos below.

## Step 3. Start a job on 3D printer

 1. Check amount of resin in material tray
 2. Shaking and pour more resin into material tray
 3. Double check the printing platform is clear
 4. Find the submitted job and start
 
 You can also follow the video below.

## Step 4. Post-process 3D printed model(s)

Follow the video below.

## Additional information

# Printability
To determine if an STL file is printable, we need to check if the 3D object is watertight. Only watertight 3D objects can be printed. Below are two examples:

|Type|Example|Printable|
|--|--|--|
|Scan with a base<br />(watertight)|![](type1.jpg)|Yes|
|Scan without a base<br />(non-watertight)|![](type2.jpg)|No|
 
 # Printing Direction
In dental 3D printing, two common printing directions are defined: horizontal and vertical. Their pros and cons are summarized in the table below:
|Type|Pros|Cons|
|--|--|--|
|Horizontal|1. Faster<br />2. More accurate    |Fewer models can be printed in a single job|
|Vertical|More models can be printed in a single job|1. Longer printing time for a job<br />2. More overhang, sometimes causing accuracy issues|
